# RachioClient
Skeleton for a PHP client to consume the Rachio APIs along with a space for creating an app to use this client.

Before using, set your Rachio API Key in /config/rachio_client.yaml. 

If you want to use the example in main.php to purge your sprinkler lines, you can also set the purge and recharge times in the same config file.
